* Introduction

=dired-video-thumbnail= is an Emacs package that provides =image-dired= style thumbnail viewing for video files. It extracts thumbnails from videos using =ffmpeg= and displays them in a grid layout, allowing you to visually browse and manage video collections directly from Emacs.

- *Click to play* - Open videos in your preferred external player
- *Resizable thumbnails* - Adjust thumbnail size on the fly

* Requirements

- Emacs 28.1 or later

* Installation

** Manual

Download =dired-video-thumbnail.el= and place it in your load-path:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dired-video-thumbnail/")
(require 'dired-video-thumbnail)
#+end_src

** use-package

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dired-video-thumbnail
  :load-path "/path/to/dired-video-thumbnail/"
  :bind (:map dired-mode-map
         ("C-t v" . dired-video-thumbnail)))
#+end_src

** straight.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(dired-video-thumbnail :type git :host github :repo "username/dired-video-thumbnail"))
#+end_src

* Usage

** Basic Usage

1. Open a directory containing video files in dired
2. Run =M-x dired-video-thumbnail=
3. A new buffer opens displaying thumbnails for all videos in the directory

** With Marked Files

1. In dired, mark specific video files with =m=
2. Run =M-x dired-video-thumbnail=
3. Only thumbnails for the marked videos are displayed

** Suggested Keybinding

Add a keybinding in dired for quick access:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-t v") #'dired-video-thumbnail))
#+end_src

* Keybindings

In the =*Video Thumbnails*= buffer:

** Navigation

| Key       | Command                              | Description                    |
|-----------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------|
| =n=       | ~dired-video-thumbnail-next~         | Move to next thumbnail         |
| =p=       | ~dired-video-thumbnail-previous~     | Move to previous thumbnail     |
| =d=       | ~dired-video-thumbnail-goto-dired~   | Switch to associated dired buffer |
| =q=       | ~quit-window~                        | Close the thumbnail buffer     |

** Playback

| Key       | Command                              | Description                    |
|-----------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------|

| =mouse-1= | ~dired-video-thumbnail-play~         | Play video (click)             |

** Marking

Marks are synchronised with the associated dired buffer, so marking a video in the thumbnail view also marks it in dired, and vice versa.

| Key       | Command                                  | Description                    |

| =m=       | ~dired-video-thumbnail-mark~             | Mark video and move to next    |
| =u=       | ~dired-video-thumbnail-unmark~           | Unmark video and move to next  |
| =SPC=     | ~dired-video-thumbnail-toggle-mark~      | Toggle mark on video at point  |
| =mouse-3= | ~dired-video-thumbnail-toggle-mark~      | Toggle mark (right-click)      |
| =M=       | ~dired-video-thumbnail-mark-all~         | Mark all videos                |

| =g= | ~dired-video-thumbnail-regenerate~     | Regenerate thumbnail at point    |
| =G= | ~dired-video-thumbnail-regenerate-all~ | Regenerate all thumbnails        |

* Customisation

All customisation options are in the =dired-video-thumbnail= group. Use =M-x customize-group RET dired-video-thumbnail RET= to browse them interactively.

** Thumbnail Cache Location

Thumbnails are stored in =~/.emacs.d/dired-video-thumbnails/= by default:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-cache-dir "~/path/to/cache/")
#+end_src

** Thumbnail Size

Control the generated thumbnail size and display height:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-size 200)           ;; Generated thumbnail size (pixels)
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-display-height 150) ;; Display height in buffer
#+end_src

Thumbnails are generated as squares to ensure consistent grid alignment regardless of video aspect ratio.

** Grid Layout

Set the number of columns in the thumbnail grid:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-columns 4)
#+end_src

** Thumbnail Timestamp

By default, thumbnails are extracted at 5 seconds into the video. Change this to get a more representative frame:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-timestamp "00:00:10")  ;; 10 seconds in
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-timestamp "00:01:00")  ;; 1 minute in
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-timestamp nil)         ;; Let ffmpeg choose
#+end_src

** Video Player

Set your preferred video player (defaults to =mpv=):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-video-player "mpv")
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-video-player "vlc")
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-video-player nil)  ;; Use system default via xdg-open
#+end_src

** Video Extensions

Add or modify recognised video file extensions:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-video-extensions
      '("mp4" "mkv" "avi" "mov" "webm" "m4v" "wmv" "flv" "mpeg" "mpg" "ogv" "3gp"))
#+end_src

** Mark Border Appearance

Marked thumbnails are indicated with a coloured border. Customise the border width and colour:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-mark-border-width 4)  ;; Border width in pixels

;; Change border colour via the face
(set-face-foreground 'dired-video-thumbnail-mark "blue")
#+end_src

** ffmpeg Path

If ffmpeg is not in your PATH:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-video-thumbnail-ffmpeg-program "/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg")
#+end_src

* Example Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dired-video-thumbnail
  :load-path "/path/to/dired-video-thumbnail/"
  :bind (:map dired-mode-map
         ("C-t v" . dired-video-thumbnail))
  :custom
  (dired-video-thumbnail-size 250)
  (dired-video-thumbnail-display-height 180)
  (dired-video-thumbnail-columns 5)
  (dired-video-thumbnail-timestamp "00:00:10")
  (dired-video-thumbnail-video-player "mpv")
  (dired-video-thumbnail-mark-border-width 5)
  :custom-face
  (dired-video-thumbnail-mark ((t (:foreground "orange")))))
#+end_src

* Cache Management

Thumbnails are cached based on the file path and modification time. If you modify a video file, the thumbnail will be automatically regenerated on next view.

To manually clear the entire cache:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x dired-video-thumbnail-clear-cache
#+end_src

* Workflow Examples

** Reviewing and Deleting Unwanted Videos

1. Open a directory with videos in dired
2. =C-t v= to open thumbnail view
3. Browse thumbnails with =n= and =p=
4. Mark unwanted videos with =m=
5. Press =x= to delete marked videos (with confirmation)

** Selecting Videos for Processing

1. Open thumbnail view with =C-t v=
2. Mark videos you want to process with =m= or =SPC=
3. Press =d= to switch to dired
4. Your marked videos are already selected in dired
5. Use any dired command (=C=, =R=, =!=, etc.) on marked files

** Quick Video Preview

1. In dired, position cursor on a video file
2. =C-t v= opens thumbnail view
3. =RET= to play the video
4. =q= to return to dired

* Troubleshooting

** Thumbnails not generating

1. Ensure ffmpeg is installed: =ffmpeg -version=
2. Check that ffmpeg is in your PATH or set =dired-video-thumbnail-ffmpeg-program=
3. Try regenerating with =g= on a specific thumbnail

** Placeholder showing instead of thumbnail

Some videos may fail to generate thumbnails if:
- The video is corrupted
- The timestamp is beyond the video duration (try setting =dired-video-thumbnail-timestamp= to =nil=)
- ffmpeg doesn't support the codec

Press =g= on the thumbnail to retry generation.

** Marks not syncing with dired

Run =M-x dired-video-thumbnail-debug= to check if the dired buffer is properly associated. The output should show a live dired buffer reference.

** Performance with many videos

The package processes up to 4 videos concurrently by default. For directories with hundreds of videos, initial thumbnail generation may take some time, but Emacs remains responsive and thumbnails appear as they complete.
